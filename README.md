# eslint-config-robatwilliams

A [shareable](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) ESLint config for rules I use.

Although it's shareable, it's probably not granular enough to be truly reusable across diverse project setups. The likely usage is to use parts of it to extend [eslint-recommended](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/conf/eslint-recommended.js) (or similar) as a starting point for a new project.

The settings for core rules are organised as per the sections of the [rules page](https://eslint.org/docs/rules) of the documentation, which [may change](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/7991).
